    "2": "No, I was born, I came \u2013 I've always been awkward throughout my life, so I came rather too quickly, and my mum said, \u201cOh, I think something's happening\u201d, and apparently, in the bathroom, I appeared!  And so my dad and grandmother did whatever, and I was booked into a Nursing Home, so my father carried me into the Nursing Home the next day, because I'd been booked in for ten days with my mother. But I wasn't born in there, I was born in my grandmother's house in Chingford.",

And then he went into the Pearl Assurance Company at the age of 16, I think, in a clerical [job] - and then he stayed with the Pearl Assurance Company until he retired at 62-ish, worked his way up from nothing to Personnel Manager for the whole of Pearl Assurance. But then he had six years in the War, in the Fleet Air Arm, as a navigator in a Swordfish, and he was then disabled out, with a serious injury, in 1944 before I was born.  And he then, after he recovered somewhat, he married my mother, and was an instructor for navigation and things, [in the] Fleet Air Arm until after the War. Then he went back to the Pearl Assurance Company.  And my boring mother was a housewife throughout her life, and had four children, so I've got three siblings.",

    "9": "No, no, no, no, no.  My father was a very bright able man, but I always would criticise him for having the same job his whole life, and I've stayed here [at the University of Surrey] for my whole [working] life and I've been even more boring!  And then at the age of five, we moved from East London, Leytonstone, in fact, to Thames Ditton, Surrey, where they moved out, into a nice semi-detached suburban house. So I grew up, basically, in Surrey, in Thames Ditton.",
